# 0.H_Candidate_Archive
Compatible Version: Experimental, January 4th, 2024. Installed version: cdda-android-x64-2024-01-04-2303.apk

Prepping for 0.H stable by getting everything running on the candidate.

STOP. Observe the version numbers above. If you're not running the same version, likely you're going to have errors. I don't want to hear about the mods not working on the latest version when the compatible version is clearly labeled.

Ongoing backup of my mods directory. YMMV, use at own risk, BACKUP YOUR SAVES and above all, don't bitch at me about errors unless you are offering a fix. I won't act quickly, but the fix will be there when I do.

Addendum: It has come to my attention that a vocal minority of individuals cannot comprehend the difference between a mod that comes with the base game and a mod they sourced from outside the cataclysm repository. Errors with the first should definitely be reported to cdda's github repo. Errors with the second SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT be reported in cdda's repo. The devs will NOT support out of repo mods so don't ask. Apparently you're all bugging the devs (about KENAN's mods, lol) and I get to soak up the grief because I'm not banned from the discord. Quit it.
