# Slime-a-clysm

A mod of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, where the world changes to one full of slime monsters instead of zombies

I also created my own various types of slime monsters and a slime forest that may appear in-game as well

## How to use this mod
- Have Cataclysm: DDA, 0.G stable installed

## Current slime monster variants in this mod
- Slime - a regular green slime, has no special abilities
- Red slime - regenerates its health over time
- Orange slime - faster than the green slime
- Yellow slime - has electric attacks
- Cyan slime - deals additional cold damage and emits cold air
- Blue slime - emits a blue cloud of gas that causes a disorientation effect
- Purple slime - Randomly teleports short distances every so often
- Pink slime - regenerates its own health, heals nearby allies
- Transparent slime - It's so transparent that it's hard to see from a distance (becomes invisible beyond a certain distance depending on Perception)
- Dasher slime - Occasionally dashes forward quickly towards a target
- Black slime - It absorbs light, making it almost invisible in the dark unless adjacent
- Dissolver slime - Attempts to wrap around its target, then secrete a highly acidic chemical
- Speedy slime - It is very fast and has a higher dodge
- Booster slime - can speed up itself and its allies
- Queen slime - A gigantic slime that can spawn new slimes, and may try to cover its target in slime as well.
- Slime biter - small, very fast and aggressive red slimes, will attempt to bite the target 

In addition, each type has a large variant. The large variants are larger and tougher, and they split into two of the normal-sized variants on death.
