My response to the current state of charges making unloading 100 pills from a bottle take 5 minutes or longer. 

Reduced access times on all containers in the core json of same name. Doesn't affect access times for anything else, but vastly reduces the charges change impact.

Will be retired when that whole thing is dealt with. Soon.

Will be keeping reduced access times for select items, like paper wrappers and plastic bags, just for QoL autopickup sorting uses.
