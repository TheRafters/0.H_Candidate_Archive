For all my personal, non-mainline mods.

Transplantables includes a new vehicle part, Tree Spade, which is a random substitute for the Steel Boom on tow trucks. When you have a vehicle with this part installed and engaged, you can dig up a tree in a fraction of the time.
Without it, you can still dig up a tree, but it will be with a shovel only and very grueling work lasting around 8 hours. Digging up a tree requires a new container, Arboreal Canvas Sack, which is basically 4 canvas sacks sewn together.
It also requires 200 units of water. These are necessary to protect the rootball of the tree from drying out, which would kill it. When you plant the tree, you get the sack back as a byproduct. You will leave a pit where you dug out a tree.
You will need a pit to plant the tree in.

Bushes can be dug up with a shovel and take only a couple hours to dig out. You can plant them anywhere.

ElectricZsHaveCBMs adds a chance for dissecting electric-related zombies to yield CBMs. Most of these are faulty bionics. There's also a chance to get a power storage system, and a very tiny chance to get one of several shock CBMs.
It's strictly civilian-grade stuff here.
